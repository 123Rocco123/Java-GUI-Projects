330 BC - Cholchis

Alexander the Great now having defeated the Persian army stands in their formal capital, Persepolis.

*A faint chanting can be heard from outside of the palace, the sound of Alexander's army as they celebrate their long awaited victory.*

But Alexander nervously paces throughout the palace's throne room, knowing that an important matter still has to be resolved.

For days now he's heard rumors of the legendary Golden Fleece being kept in the palace, at the heart of the Persian Empire, which allegedly possessed the power to heal any living or undead creature.

Soon, Alexander heard heavy footsteps approaching him, when suddenly Hephaestion, Alexander's most trusted ally and friend wearing full Macedon armor, entered into the throne room.

"Alex, come with us quickly, we found it". Alexander as quickly and discreetly as possible followed Hephaestion to the personal chambers of the old king of Persia. Once in the room, Hephaestion quickly moved to the right end of the room, and pushing against a stone revealed a hidden door made of stone on a swivel.

The two men then went down a flight of stairs and eventually arrived to a dark room which smelled of smoke, and who's stone walls had been charred. At the end of this room on a pedestal, Alexander spotted a fleece that somehow seemed to emit a glow of its own, at once he knew what it was.

Hephaestion turned to Alexander and said: "We interrogated every living soldier that was guarding the palace, and only one of them knew something about this room. Apparently, as we were nearing the palace Darius ordered his royal guard to burn this room to the ground, and destroy the part of the palace which contained it. Fortunately, as they were about to tear the building apart, our legions arrived at the palace.
