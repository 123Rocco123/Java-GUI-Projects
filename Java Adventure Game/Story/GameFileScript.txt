330 BC - Cholchis

Alexander the Great now having defeated the Persian army stands in their formal capital, Persepolis.

*A faint chanting can be heard from outside of the palace, the sound of Alexander's army as they celebrate their long awaited victory.*

But Alexander nervously paces throughout the palace's throne room, knowing that an important matter still has to be resolved.

For days now he's heard rumors of the legendary Golden Fleece being kept in the palace, at the heart of the Persian Empire, which allegedly possessed the power to heal any living or undead creature.

Soon, Alexander heard heavy footsteps approaching him, when suddenly a man wearing Macedon armor entered into the throne room.
